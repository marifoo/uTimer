# µTimer

A lightweight desktop timer that tracks your active and pause time and gets
out of your way. Lock your PC, take a break, come back — µTimer keeps the
numbers honest without you having to remember to press anything.

## Features

- **Lock detection.** When you lock the screen, µTimer pauses automatically.
  When you come back, it resumes. No manual click needed.
- **Smart auto-pause.** Short lock-screens (e.g. a quick chat at the door)
  don't count as breaks. Only locks longer than a configurable threshold
  (15 minutes by default) are treated as pauses.
- **Editable history.** Optionally keep a history of past sessions and
  fix-up entries after the fact if you forgot to start or stop the timer.
- **Crash-resilient.** µTimer checkpoints the running session every few
  minutes, so a power cut or unexpected reboot doesn't lose your tracked
  time.
- **Stays out of the way.** Pin-to-top and minimize-to-tray modes; the app
  is small enough to leave in a corner of your screen.

## Install

### Windows

Grab the latest pre-built release from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/marifoo/uTimer/releases) and run the
executable. No installer, no admin rights — just drop it in a folder and
start it.

### Linux (build from source)

There is no pre-built binary for Linux, but the app builds and runs on it.
You will need Qt 5 (5.14 or later), a recent GCC, and `qmake`:

```sh
qmake uTimer.pro
make
./uTimer
```

Lock detection on Linux uses D-Bus — systemd-logind, GNOME, KDE, or the
generic freedesktop screensaver, whichever responds first.

## Using it

The main window shows your accumulated **Activity** and **Pause** time for
the current day, plus the time you started.

- **Start / Pause / Stop** — the obvious controls.
- **History** — opens a dialog where you can browse past days and edit
  entries (split a segment, change Activity↔Pause, etc.).
- **Auto-Pause** — toggles whether long locks count as pauses.
- **Pin / Tray** — keeps the window on top, or hides it to the system tray.

µTimer resets at midnight and writes each day's totals to its history.

## Settings

After the first launch, a `user-settings.ini` file appears next to the
binary. The interesting keys:

| Key | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autopause_enabled` | `true` | Master switch for auto-pause. |
| `autopause_threshold_minutes` | `15` | Locks shorter than this stay counted as Activity. |
| `history_days_to_keep` | `99` | How many days of history to retain. `0` disables history entirely. |
| `press_start_button_on_app_start` | `true` | Start the timer automatically on launch. |
| `start_minimized_to_tray` | `false` | Launch hidden in the system tray. |
| `start_pinned_to_top` | `false` | Launch with always-on-top enabled. |
| `show_warning_after_9h45min_activity` | `false` | Nudge after a long active stretch. |
| `show_warning_when_not_30min_pause_after_6h_activity` | `false` | Nudge if you haven't taken a real break. |

## For contributors

If you are looking at the source rather than just running the app, see
[`doc/`](doc/README.md) for architecture and design documentation.
