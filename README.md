µTimer
======
µTimer is a lightweight timer application for Windows, specifically to help you track your activity and pause times during remote work.

Key Features:

 * *Lock Detection*: Automatically detects when the user locks the computer and transitions into pause mode, ensuring accurate tracking of active work time.
 
 * *Auto-Pause*: Only counts locks longer than a configurable duration (default is 15 minutes) as pauses. This feature ensures that brief interruptions do not impact your overall activity tracking.

 * *History Tracking*: An optional history feature allows you to maintain (and edit!) a record of your past activities, giving you control over your tracking preferences.

After the first start, make sure to check the `user-settings.ini` file to configure these options.


This app is open-source and available at [Github](https://github.com/marifoo/uTimer). The latest pre-compiled release can be found there under *Releases*.
