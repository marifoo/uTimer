/**
 * SessionStore — Abstract interface for time-duration persistence.
 *
 * Extracted from the concrete SqliteSessionStore class so that Timer
 * (and anything else that needs DB access) can depend on an abstraction
 * rather than the SQLite implementation.  This enables:
 *
 *   - FakeSessionStore in tests: records every call, returns
 *     configurable success/failure, stores data in memory (no SQLite).
 *   - Easier reasoning about which DB operations Timer actually needs.
 *
 * Every public method that Timer calls on SqliteSessionStore is
 * represented here as a pure virtual.  Internal helpers (ensureOpen,
 * ensureSchema, createBackup, etc.) remain private implementation details
 * of the concrete class.
 *
 * ── Unified result vocabulary ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * All store methods that can fail use SessionStoreResult::Category to
 * report their outcome.  The categories have consistent meanings across
 * every method:
 *
 *   Success       — operation completed; any returned data is valid.
 *
 *   Disabled      — history storage is disabled (history_days_to_keep == 0).
 *                   The call was a no-op.  This is not an error; callers
 *                   should treat the absence of data as intentional.
 *                   Retrying with the same arguments will always return
 *                   Disabled until history is re-enabled.
 *
 *   TransientError — a recoverable failure (e.g. SQL execution error,
 *                   transaction could not start).  The caller may retry;
 *                   data was not mutated.
 *
 *   FatalError    — unrecoverable failure (e.g. DB connection lost).
 *                   Callers should emit a user warning and refuse new sessions.
 *
 *   CallerBug     — invalid input supplied by the caller (e.g. empty
 *                   segment_id, or a segment_id that already belongs to
 *                   finalized history).  Retrying with the same arguments
 *                   will not help.  Log as critical.
 *
 * Methods that carry additional payload (loadDurations, hasEntriesForDate)
 * embed a status field that uses the same categories.  The per-method
 * contract matrices in test_contract_matrix.cpp document which categories
 * apply to each method.
